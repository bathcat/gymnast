### What __is__ agile?

> Agile is an iterative approach to project 
> management and software development that 
> helps teams deliver value to their customers
> faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of
> betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an
> agile team delivers work in small, but consumable,
> increments. Requirements, plans, and results are 
> evaluated continuously so teams have a natural 
> mechanism for responding to change quickly.

### Making Agile Your Own
> Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies 
> or specific development techniques. Rather, 
> agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate 
> a commitment to tight feedback cycles and 
> continuous improvement.
