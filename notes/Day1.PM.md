## Sprint Planning
* Pretend you're actually building this
* Determine total sprint work hours:
  * Number of people * 40 * 2 * .75 - Vacation 
* Come up with enough tasks to fill those hours



### Recipe
1. Pull the most important task off the product backlog
2. Decompose into tasks
  - Estimates in hours
3. Add any non-functional tasks required by #2
  - e.g. Set up repository
  - Create build pipeline
  - Set up skeleton project(s)
4. Repeat until hours are gone
